In out linux basics we already discussed that linux does not have extentions to the files. 
It considers extention as filename itself, However as as user we want to know what type of file it is. & Easy way of identifying is by extentions. 
That is the reason that we always try to make extensions for the file we create.  

In shell we are creating scripts and those we are going to give extension to understand that as a shell script. 


- We learn bash shell here
- So the filenames can be .bash or even a lot of people still use .sh, Since linux does not bother about anything any extension is OK. It is our compfort.
- I prefer using .sh over .bash 
- We can execute the script as `bash script.sh`
